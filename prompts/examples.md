EXAMPLE 1
INPUT:

python
def average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)

    
EXPECTED OUTPUT

🐞 Bugs Detected:

Division by zero can occur if numbers is an empty list.

⚠️ Code Smells:

Manual summing; could use the built-in sum() function for clarity and efficiency.

No input type checking (e.g., what if non-numeric elements are provided?).

No docstring.

🚀 Optimization Suggestions:

Use the built-in sum() for summing.

Add input validation and error handling.

🧼 Refactored Code:

python
def average(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the average of a list of numbers.
    Raises ValueError if the list is empty or contains non-numeric elements.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty.")
    try:
        return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    except TypeError:
        raise ValueError("All elements must be numbers.")


EXPLANATION

Added docstring for clarity.

Used sum() for cleaner and potentially faster summing.

Checked for an empty list to avoid ZeroDivisionError.

Wrapped calculation in try-except to handle non-numeric inputs gracefully.

EXAMPLE 2
INPUT:

python
def palindrome(s):
    reversed = ""
    for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):
        reversed += s[i]
    if reversed == s:
        return True
    else:
        return False


EXPECTED OUTPUT

🐞 Bugs Detected:

No critical bugs, but inefficient string reversal and redundant boolean return.

⚠️ Code Smells:

Inefficient string concatenation in a loop (O(n^2) complexity).

Returns True or False via an if-else, but comparison already yields a boolean.

Variable name reversed shadows the built-in reversed() function.

No input validation or docstring.

🚀 Optimization Suggestions:

Use slicing for string reversal.

Return the boolean comparison directly.

Add docstring and sanity checks.

🧼 Refactored Code:

python
def is_palindrome(s):
    """
    Checks if the provided string is a palindrome.
    """
    if not isinstance(s, str):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a string.")
    return s == s[::-1]


EXPLANATION

Used string slicing for efficient reversal.

Function returns the boolean result of comparison directly.

Renamed reversed to avoid shadowing built-in.

Added input type checking and docstring.

EXAMPLE 3
INPUT:

python
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    while n > 0:
        result *= n
        n = n - 1
    return result


EXPECTED OUTPUT

🐞 Bugs Detected:

No check for negative numbers or non-integer inputs. May compute incorrect results or enter infinite loops if misused.

⚠️ Code Smells:

Lacks docstring or input validation.

Expects integer input, but doesn't enforce or explain.

🚀 Optimization Suggestions:

Add type and value checks (non-negative integers).

Use recursion or math library if appropriate.

🧼 Refactored Code:

python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Computes the factorial of a non-negative integer n.
    Raises ValueError for invalid inputs.
    """
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise ValueError("Input must be an integer.")
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be non-negative.")
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

EXPLANATION

Added input validation for type and value.

Used a for loop (more pythonic for this use case).

Docstring explains function and possible errors.

EXAMPLE 4
INPUT:

python
def unique(lst):
    seen = []
    for i in lst:
        if i not in seen:
            seen.append(i)
    return seen

EXPECTED OUTPUT

🐞 Bugs Detected:

No critical bugs; function will work as intended for hashable and unhashable types.

⚠️ Code Smells:

Inefficient in checks on a list (O(n^2) for large inputs).

Doesn't use more appropriate data structures like set for membership tests.

Lacks a docstring.

🚀 Optimization Suggestions:

Use a set for faster membership checks during construction; preserve order using a list.

Add a docstring.

🧼 Refactored Code:

python
def unique(lst):
    """
    Returns a list of unique elements in the order of their first appearance.
    """
    seen = set()
    unique_list = []
    for item in lst:
        if item not in seen:
            unique_list.append(item)
            seen.add(item)
    return unique_list

EXPLANATION

Uses a set for O(1) membership checks to improve performance.

Maintains order using the output list.

Added docstring.

EXAMPLE 5
INPUT:

python
def find_max(numbers):
    max = 0
    for n in numbers:
        if n > max:
            max = n
    return max
EXPECTED OUTPUT

🐞 Bugs Detected:

Bug when all numbers are negative (will return 0, which may not be in the list).

No check for empty input (could raise ValueError or incorrect output).

⚠️ Code Smells:

Shadowing built-in function max.

No docstring or error handling.

Inefficient for non-numeric or empty lists.

🚀 Optimization Suggestions:

Use built-in max() with error handling; avoid shadowing.

Add docstring and input validation.

🧼 Refactored Code:

python
def find_max(numbers):
    """
    Returns the maximum value from a non-empty list of numbers.
    Raises ValueError on empty input.
    """
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list is empty.")
    return max(numbers)
EXPLANATION

Now raises an exception for empty input.

Uses Python's built-in max() for clarity, speed, and correctness.

Added docstring and prevented name shadowing.
